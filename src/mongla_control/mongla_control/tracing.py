"""Per-command MAVLink trace tag (lean, off-by-default).

ONE responsibility: when an operator runs the manager with `debug:=true`,
every MAVLink frame Pixhawk emits gets a tag in its DEBUG log line that
names the high-level Mongla verb that caused it. That turns this:

    [MAV send_rc_override] yaw=1430
    [MAV send_rc_override] yaw=1500

into this:

    [MAV send_rc_override cmd=lock_heading] yaw=1430
    [MAV send_rc_override cmd=yaw_right]    yaw=1500

so a single `rg "cmd=yaw_right"` over a session log shows EVERY frame
the verb produced, across files, without any per-call boilerplate.

Public surface (only three things):

    command_scope(verb)  -- context manager wrapping ONE Mongla call
    current_tag()        -- 'cmd=<verb>' or '' (read by Pixhawk._log_mavlink)
    set_enabled(bool)    -- flip tracing on (manager calls when debug:=true)

Design constraints (set by the user):

* No counters, no UUIDs -- just the verb name. `cmd=yaw_right`, never
  `cmd=yaw_right#42`. Multiple invocations look identical and that is
  fine; we trace by ordering, not by id.
* Off by default. Production runs stay quiet. The manager flips it on
  via `set_enabled(True)` only when the `debug` ROS-param is true.
* Background daemons (Heartbeat, HeadingLock) live in their own
  threads. ContextVar values do NOT propagate across `threading.Thread`
  boundaries, so their MAVLink frames will simply lack the `cmd=` tag
  -- they'll still show their `_log_mavlink` callsite (e.g.
  `send_rc_override`), which is enough to identify them. This is
  intentional: we trade tag breadth for keeping the daemons free of
  tracing imports.
