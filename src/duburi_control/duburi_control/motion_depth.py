"""Depth-drive loop -- canonical Blue Robotics pattern.

We send an absolute depth setpoint via ``SET_POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT``
and let ArduSub's onboard 400 Hz depth controller drive Ch3. The yaw
axis is the inverse pattern: there we write Ch4 rate-overrides and
do the loop in Python because we don't trust ArduSub's compass; here
we trust ArduSub's pressure sensor + onboard depth PID, so the Python
side is just a setpoint streamer (5 Hz) plus a "did we get there"
watchdog. No Python PID stacked on top of ArduSub's loop, no Ch3 RC
override fights.

Caller is expected to have already engaged ALT_HOLD (the only mode
that honours the absolute-Z setpoint and also holds the current depth
between frames). ``Duburi.set_depth`` invokes ``_ensure_alt_hold``
first so direct callers of this function do not have to.

Two phases:

  Phase 1 -- prime_alt_hold (0.5 s)
      Stream the *current* depth as the target while sending a neutral
      RC override. This drains any stale ALT_HOLD integrator state from
      a previous mode entry (well-known ArduSub quirk where the
      depth-hold I-term is not reset on mode switch -- see the Blue
      Robotics forum thread "Depth Hold Problems?"). Without this the
      first frame can fire the vertical thrusters at full power.

  Phase 2 -- wait_for_depth (until tolerance or timeout)
      Stream the real target at 5 Hz. Poll AHRS depth; return None when
      the error falls below TOL_M; raise MovementTimeout otherwise
      (caught by the action server and surfaced as
      Move.Result.success = False).
