"""Yaw command implementations.

Two variants with identical signatures:

  yaw_snap(pixhawk, start_heading, end_heading, timeout, label, log, yaw_source=None)
      Bang-bang. Closed rate loop on Ch4: ``yaw_pct = kp * err`` each
      tick (error measured against ``yaw_source``). When the source
      reads the target, Ch4 -> 1500 and the vehicle stops. Fast.

  yaw_glide(pixhawk, start_heading, end_heading, timeout, label, log, yaw_source=None)
      Smoothed. Same rate loop but the setpoint is swept with
      smootherstep from ``start`` to ``end`` over ``duration`` seconds
      before locking at ``end``. No overshoot because the sweep's own
      rate decays to zero at the target.

Why rate-based and not absolute-attitude
----------------------------------------
ArduSub's absolute-attitude controller closes the physical loop on
ArduSub's *own* compass/AHRS. On the real vehicle that compass is
corrupted by thruster ESCs (the whole reason a BNO085 exists on the
AUV). On Gazebo SITL it is the sim compass, which has no coupling to
the external ``yaw_source`` the operator picked. Both variants below
instead write Ch4 directly via ``send_rc_override(yaw=...)``: ArduSub
treats any Ch4 override != 1500 as a pilot yaw-rate command and stops
using its own compass to close the heading loop. The BNO (or whichever
source is configured) is now the sole feedback for both the rate
command and the termination check. Identical pattern to the one
``motion_vision`` uses for vision-driven yaw.

Both use the same tolerance / lock-frame exit so callers see identical
success/timeout semantics. On success: return ``None`` silently. On
timeout: raise ``MovementTimeout`` (caught by the action server,
surfaced as ``Move.Result.success = False``).

Yaw source selection
--------------------
``yaw_source`` is an optional ``duburi_sensors.YawSource``. When None
(default), both functions read the current heading from
``pixhawk.get_attitude()['yaw']``. When provided (e.g. BNO085Source),
``read_yaw()`` is called and the AHRS is bypassed. If the source
returns None for a tick (stale sample, parse error), we hold the last
valid heading; if it stays silent longer than ``STALE_HOLD_S`` we
park Ch4 at 1500 (safe stop) until the source recovers.
