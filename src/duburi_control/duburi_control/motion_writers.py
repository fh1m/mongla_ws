"""Shared infrastructure for the per-axis motion modules.

`motion_forward.py` and `motion_lateral.py` both use the same thrust
envelope, the same brake-kick / settle, and the same heading-drift
logging. Centralising it here keeps the per-axis files focused on
*which channel they write* and nothing else.

Heading-lock awareness
----------------------
When a ``lock_heading`` is active, the lock thread streams Ch4
rate-overrides continuously. Any RC override that touches Ch4 from a
translation command -- even at the neutral 1500 us value -- would
race against that stream because both writers share the same RC
slot. The ``Writers`` family below exposes two flavours so the
translation modules can stay agnostic of which writer they use:

  release_yaw=False  ->  pixhawk.send_rc_override(...)
                         Ch4 gets 1500 explicitly, ArduSub's internal
                         heading-hold latches at the current heading.
                         Default: every motion command without an
                         active heading lock.

  release_yaw=True   ->  pixhawk.send_rc_translation(...)
                         Ch4 stays released (65535) so the HeadingLock
                         thread is the sole author of Ch4. Used while
                         a heading lock is active.

The Duburi facade picks the flavour based on ``_lock_active()`` and
hands a fully-built ``Writers`` to the per-axis module. The per-axis
module never has to know about lock state.
