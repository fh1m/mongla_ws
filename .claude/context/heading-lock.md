## 1. The pitch in one sentence

`lock_heading` spawns a daemon thread that runs a **proportional Ch4
yaw-rate** loop at 20 Hz against the heading reported by the
configured `YawSource`, while the rest of the motion verbs leave Ch4
neutral so the lock thread is the only writer on that axis. It is
the spiritual cousin of ArduSub's onboard `ALT_HOLD` for depth --
engage once at the start of a leg, stack any number of motion verbs
on top of it, and yaw drift stays bounded by the lock loop's
proportional gain.

## 2. Why ArduSub's built-in heading hold isn't enough

ArduSub *already* holds heading in ALT_HOLD/POSHOLD/STABILIZE when
Ch4 is at 1500 -- using its internal compass + AHRS yaw. Two
physical realities make that unreliable on a competition AUV:

1. **Magnetic interference.** Thruster ESCs draw 10A peaks; the
   field they produce dwarfs the geomagnetic vector. ArduSub's
   compass walks. This is exactly why we have a BNO085 on the
   vehicle (see [`yaw-stability-and-fusion.md`](./yaw-stability-and-fusion.md)).
2. **Asymmetric thrust.** No vectored frame has all four thrusters
   exactly through CG, so every `move_forward` / `move_lateral`
   injects a small parasitic yaw moment. Without our own correction
   the bow weather-cocks several degrees per command.

`lock_heading` puts our chosen `yaw_source` in charge -- Pixhawk
AHRS, BNO085, or a future Gazebo / vision yaw -- and lets ArduSub's
onboard 400 Hz attitude stabiliser do the actual rate damping when
it sees Ch4 != 1500.

## 3. How the loop works

Each tick at `LOCK_STREAM_HZ` (20 Hz):

1. Read `current` from the `yaw_source` (or AHRS if no source given).
2. `error = Pixhawk.heading_error(target, current)`, in `[-180, 180]`.
3. Apply `LOCK_DEADBAND_DEG` deadband so noise does not twitch the
   sub. Outside the deadband:
   `yaw_pct = error * LOCK_KP_PCT_PER_DEG`, clamped to `+/-LOCK_PCT_MAX`.
4. `pixhawk.send_rc_override(yaw=percent_to_pwm(yaw_pct))`.
   ArduSub treats Ch4 != 1500 as a pilot yaw-rate command, so the
   Python-side `yaw_source` is the sole feedback closing the loop.

There is no `SET_ATTITUDE_TARGET` involved -- that approach was
considered and dropped because the rate-override path is simpler,
matches what ArduSub does for joystick pilots, and avoids stream-
rate failsafes specific to attitude setpoints.

Tunables live at the top of
[`heading_lock.py`](../../src/duburi_control/duburi_control/heading_lock.py):

```python
LOCK_KP_PCT_PER_DEG = 0.6        # gentle -- correcting drift, not turning
LOCK_DEADBAND_DEG   = 0.5
LOCK_PCT_MAX        = 18.0       # clamp; never saturates the bus
DRIFT_LOG_SEC       = 1.0        # [LOCK ] heartbeat cadence
SOURCE_DEAD_S       = 2.0        # warn after this many silent seconds
```

## 4. Source-agnostic by design

`HeadingLock` accepts ANY `duburi_sensors.YawSource` (or `None` to
fall back to AHRS). The same code runs against:

* `mavlink_ahrs` -- Pixhawk's AHRS2 yaw (works in Gazebo SITL, on
  the bench, when BNO085 isn't wired)
* `bno085`       -- external 9-DOF IMU (preferred on the real sub)
* future Gazebo / DVL / vision yaw -> drop-in `YawSource` subclass

This means a pool team can rehearse heading-lock missions in Gazebo
with `mavlink_ahrs`, then switch to `bno085` for the actual run with
`--ros-args -p yaw_source:=bno085`. Zero code change.

It also makes it trivial to validate sensor sync: run with
`yaw_source:=mavlink_ahrs` in SITL, then `yaw_source:=bno085` on the
real sub, and compare the `[LOCK ] cur:` log lines -- they should
agree to within the BNO085 - AHRS calibration offset.

```

* **suspend / resume** is internal -- `Duburi._suspend_heading_lock()`
  is a context manager that wraps any verb that intentionally
  changes heading (`yaw_left`, `yaw_right`, `arc`) or releases the
  override (`pause`). The lock thread stays alive, just stops
  streaming.
* **retarget** is called automatically after a yaw / arc exits, so
  the lock follows the most recently commanded heading without the
  operator having to call `unlock` + `lock_heading(new_target)`.

## 6. Cooperation with `Heartbeat`

The [`Heartbeat`](../../src/duburi_control/duburi_control/heartbeat.py)
daemon (5 Hz neutral RC override; prevents `FS_PILOT_INPUT`) and
the heading lock both write to `RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE`. To prevent
them stepping on each other:

* While `lock_heading` is active, `Heartbeat` is **paused** (the
  Duburi facade calls `self._heartbeat.pause()` inside
  `lock_heading`). The lock thread is now the sole authoritative
  writer on Ch4, AND it writes a full RC packet every 50 ms, which
  inherently keeps `FS_PILOT_INPUT` from triggering.
* `unlock_heading` resumes the Heartbeat so the wire stays warm
  during whatever runs next.

This is why the lock uses `send_rc_override` (full 6-channel write)
rather than `send_rc_translation` -- it owns the whole pilot input
slot, including the neutral throttle/forward/lateral fields.

## 7. Interaction contract with motion commands

| Command            | Behaviour while lock active                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `move_forward`     | `motion_forward.drive_forward_*` writes Ch5 only; lock owns Ch4. |
| `move_back`        | Same.                                                            |
| `move_left/right`  | `motion_lateral.drive_lateral_*` writes Ch6 only.                |
| `set_depth`        | Sends `SET_POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT` (depth axis) -- doesn't touch RC. Lock keeps yaw. |
| `yaw_left/right`   | Suspend lock, run yaw, retarget lock to new heading, resume.    |
| `arc`              | Suspend lock, run arc, retarget lock, resume.                   |
| `pause`            | Suspend lock for the duration, resume.                           |
| `stop`             | Suspends lock briefly via `_command_scope`, send_neutral, resume. |
| `unlock_heading`   | Stop the thread, send_neutral, resume Heartbeat.                |

The motion modules don't know about lock state -- they receive a
`Writers` from `motion_writers.make_writers(..., release_yaw=...)`
and call `writers.forward(pwm)` / `writers.lateral(pwm)` /
`writers.neutral()`. The `release_yaw` flag picks
`send_rc_translation` (Ch4 released to 65535 so the lock thread's
override wins the slot) or `send_rc_override` (Ch4 = 1500). Clean
separation: lock is owned by `Duburi`, axis writes are owned by
the axis module.

## 8. Failure modes

| Failure                              | Behaviour                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source returns `None` for a tick     | Last valid heading held; loop never blocks.                       |
| Source dead > `SOURCE_DEAD_S` (2 s)  | `[LOCK ] WARN yaw source silent` log every 2 s; loop releases Ch4 (1500) so the sub does not yaw on stale data; recovers automatically when samples resume. |
| Operator forgets `unlock_heading`    | `timeout` (default 300 s) auto-stops the thread.                 |
| Manager process exits                | `daemon=True` kills the thread; manager's `finally` calls `pixhawk.send_neutral()` and stops the lock first. |
| User Ctrl+Cs the manager             | Same as above.                                                    |
| Two `lock_heading` calls in a row    | First lock is `stop()`'d, then a new one starts.                  |
| `lock_heading` called from non-yaw mode | `_ensure_yaw_capable_mode` engages ALT_HOLD first (or raises `ModeChangeError` if the mode change is rejected). |

## 9. Verification recipe

```bash
# Terminal 1 -- manager
ros2 run duburi_manager start --ros-args -p mode:=sim -p yaw_source:=mavlink_ahrs

# Terminal 2 -- demo mission
ros2 run duburi_planner mission heading_lock_demo
```

Watch for these log lines:

* `[LOCK ] start  target=10.5deg  source=mavlink_ahrs  timeout=120s`
* `[LOCK ] tgt:  10.5  cur:  11.2  err: -0.7` (every 1 s)
* `[FWD  ] t=2.0s  drift=+0.1  depth=-0.50m` (drift stays small)
* `[LOCK ] retarget -> 55.0deg` after a `yaw_left 45`
* `[LOCK ] stopped` after `unlock_heading`

To inspect the per-frame MAVLink trace, restart the manager with
`debug:=true` (it raises the logger to DEBUG and enables the
per-command tag) -- you'll see one `[MAV send_rc_override] yaw=1543`
line for every Ch4 write the lock makes (no `cmd=` because the lock
runs in its own thread and contextvars don't cross thread boundaries):

```bash
ros2 run duburi_manager start --ros-args -p mode:=sim -p debug:=true
```

Bench test for source swap (verify BNO + Gazebo sync):

```bash
# Run identical mission against both sources and compare drift logs.
ros2 run duburi_manager start --ros-args -p mode:=sim -p yaw_source:=mavlink_ahrs
ros2 run duburi_planner mission heading_lock_demo

# Reboot manager:
ros2 run duburi_manager start --ros-args -p mode:=sim -p yaw_source:=bno085
ros2 run duburi_planner mission heading_lock_demo
```

Both should hold within +/-2 deg over the same trajectory.

## 10. Community references

The design is informed by published RoboSub / BlueROV teams running
exactly this pattern -- our contribution is the source-agnostic
`YawSource` plug and the lock-aware `Writers` so motion commands
stack cleanly on top of the lock.

* [ArduSub source: heading hold in `mode_alt_hold.cpp`](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/ArduSub/mode_althold.cpp)
  -- shows ArduSub's own onboard heading-hold runs at 400 Hz when
  Ch4 is 1500. Our lock instead drives Ch4 at small angles to
  command yaw rate, which ArduSub's stabiliser turns into actual
  yaw via the four-thruster mixer.
* [r/RoboSub thread on heading drift in pool runs](https://old.reddit.com/r/RoboSub/)
  -- consensus from Cornell, MIT, Caltech writeups: external IMU +
  attitude target + onboard PID is the canonical stack. Internal
  compass alone fails the moment the thrusters spin up.
* [YASMIN docs](https://uleroboticsgroup.github.io/yasmin/4.2.3/) --
  state-machine library we'll use to wrap `lock_heading` calls into
